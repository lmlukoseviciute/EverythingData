# Everything Data

Welcome to [**Everything Data**](https://lmlukoseviciute.github.io/EverythingData/), a personal data science and visualization portfolio by me. This site showcases selected projects ranging from interactive dashboards to statistical analysis and creative visualizations. Built with elegance and simplicity in mind, the design is based on the beautiful template by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

## Overview

This portfolio website includes:

- A responsive homepage with introduction and navigation.
- A dedicated **Projects** page showcasing visual data science work.
- External links to GitHub repositories for each project.
